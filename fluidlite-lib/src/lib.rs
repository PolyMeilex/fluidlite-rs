# Bundled fluidlite library

This crate provides bundled [fluidlite](https://github.com/katyo/fluidlite) C library
for using with [__fluidlite__](https://crates.io/crates/fluidlite) crate in case
when system-wide library is not available.

## Usage

You can simply add this as dependency to your manifest:

```toml
[dependencies]
fluidlite = "^0.1"

# Use bundled library to avoid unresolved links
fluidlite-lib = "^0.1"
```

Next you should say compiler that you want to use that crate:

```rust
// Either in traditional manner
extern crate fluidlite_lib;

// Or in Rust2018 manner
use fluidlite_lib as _;
```

## Features

You can apply some customizations to library using those features:

- __shared__ Force bundle shared (or dynamic) library instead of static
- __with-sf3__ Enable SoundFont3 support which requires ogg/vorbis (system or bundled)
- __with-stb__ Use __stb-vorbis__ instead of Xiph's libogg/libvorbis
